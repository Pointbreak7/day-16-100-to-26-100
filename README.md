Act 1

Ghost:
"I am thy father’s spirit,
Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away."

Hamlet (to himself):
"O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter!"

Act 2

Polonius:
"Though this be madness, yet there is method in’t."

Act 3

Hamlet:
"To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them?"

Hamlet (about Claudius):
"The play’s the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king."

Act 4

Queen Gertrude:
"When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
But in battalions."

Act 5

Hamlet:
"The rest is silence."

Horatio:
"Good night, sweet prince,
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"
